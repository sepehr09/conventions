# Programming Languages

This repo contains conventions for different programming languages.
Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:

- 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
- Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
- Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and
  thoroughly.
- If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well packaged and clean as any other product
  you create.

It's relevant, that some had different ideas about the best conventions, but it's important to mention that
**simplicity**, **intuitiveness**, and **consistency** is always the best policy. However, if there is anything missed
or think that should be changed please leave an issue or propose a PR.
